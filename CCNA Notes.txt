switch configuration:-
user exec mode----- enable(to go to priviledge exec mode)
priviledge exec mode------configure terminal (to go to global configuration):-






Basic Configuration:-
global configuration mode:----
hostname-----hostname [name]
banner-------banner motd & [message] &
console password------line console 0, password [pwd], login(to enable checking)
domain name stop------no ip domain-lookup
telnet password-------line vty 0 15 (for all the 16 lines),password [pwd],login
for administratively blocking the port------------shutdown
for port online----------------no shutdown
enable password-------enable password enable(telnet)
default gateway-----ip default-gateway 10.1.1.10

		

		
Priviledge Exec mode:-
saving configuration------write(builds configuration but lost when reboots)
					------copy running-config startup-config	
write erase----------------will erase startup-config from the cisco switch					
management ip------show ip interface brief		(tells about the interfaces)
int vlan1						(process of interacting the interface)
ip add 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
show run 			-------tells every detail of the switch
(Protocol shows that there is any traffic or not on the particular interface)
If we want to run any command of priviledge exec mode from global configuration then we can use the keyword "do"





Telnet:-
To check the telnet connection from pc:-(telnet is not encrypted)
set the pc configuration
telnet 10.1.1.1
>>>>>>>>>>>Doesn't let access the telnet-------no password<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Disable all connection of vty line-----line vty 0 15 ,transport input none<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>>>>Instead of enable password we should use enable secret as it is secure method<<<<<<<<<<<<<
















Troubleshooting commands:-
trunk interfaces---------------show interface trunk
Get the details of the interface----------show int f0/1 (priviledge exec mode)
Show mac-address table---------show mac address-table [dynamic/static]
port security details------------show port-security interface [name]
Know which mac address it is connected to-------------show port-security address
see startup configuration details-------show startup-config (priviledge exec)
see routing tables----------------------show ip route
show the routing protocol used in router-------------------show ip protocols

shows the clock time-----------------show clock
all possible debugging is off-------------un all
details of config register----------Show version
reload the router(priviledge exec mode)-------reload





Password Encryption Configuration:-
Encrypting the passwords----------------service password-encryption  (not safe)
								--------enable secret cisco	(global configuration)(instead of enable password)




Ip address configuration:-
int g0/1,ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0	(each interface is given an ip)(global configuration)
no shutdown






Switch conventions:-
Always start from f 0/1 (fast ethernet) and g 0/1(gigabit ethernet)

Router conventions:-
Always start from f 0/0 (fast ethernet) and g 0/0(gigabit ethernet)












Enable SSH:-(Done in global configuration)
set the hostname-----hostname
set the domain name-----ip domain-name nwking.org
secure key------------crypto key generate rsa 
bits required--------1024
ssh version 2-------ip ssh version 2
create username-----username imran password ssh123
allow ssh----------transport input ssh(in the line vty section)
for allowing ssh connection-----login local(if the vty password is set before, then use the feature local login)
To connect from pc-----ssh -l [username] [target]









Two modes for the port:-
access mode-------------switchport mode access
trunk mode--------------switchport mode trunk
Dynamic Trunking Protocol-----If there is a trunk established b/w the switches then the switch start sending packets to each other leading to privacy breach. Therefore it is recommended to stop negotiate----switchport nonegotiate
And when we set the mode it automatically disables trunking.



Address Learning----gets to know from the MAC table
Forwarding Decision---cut through, store & forward
Spanning Tree Protocol----avoidance of loops











VLAN----Virtual Lan is a technique dividing the switch into different subnets so that no other vlan can listen to the network.It will not allow to connect even if anyone gives the ip address of the same configuration as vlan.If the vlan are different it will not connect (configuration):-
vlan databases----------------------show vlan 			(priviledge exec mode)
create the vlan------------------------configure terminal,vlan 10,name management(1st vlan defined)(global configuration)
create the vlan------------------------configure terminal,vlan 20,name employees(2nd vlan defined)(global configuration)
set the vlan---------------------------int f0/1,switchport mode access,switchport access vlan 10 (global configuration)
Configuring trunk port-----------------int f0/2, switchport mode trunk (global configuration)








VTP-----VLAN Trunking Protocol---------not a trunking protocol
(only two trunking protocols are there --ISL or dot1q---IEEE standard)
This is used to synchronize the vlan tables with the other switches
VTP does not replicate if the domain names are different

Modes of VTP:-
Server----Server is only able to make changes to the VLan Tables of switch and client copies it
Client----Client is not able to make changes and just acquired the configuration
Transparent----In this the client does not acquire configuration and tells the server that i will not accept any configuration settings and i will just relay to another switch

VLan Pruning---------If another switch is not having a particular vlan then the switch avoids sending the packets of that particular vlan so that bandwidth is saved and that technique is vlan pruning


>>>>>>>>>>set vlan for the range of IP--------int range f0/2-3 and then the same commands<<<<<<<<<<<

In order to transfer packets from one switch to another switch and if there is any switch in between then we need to create the vlan so that it does not lose packet.This can be solved by VTP






VTP configuration:--
>>>>>>>>>>>>>by default all the switches are VTP server<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
to see the status of vtp-------------show vtp status (priviledge exec mode)
Setting the vtp version--------------vtp version 2 (global configuration)
setting the vtp mode(client/server/transparent)--------vtp mode server (global configuration)
setting the domain name------------------------vtp domain [domain-name] (global configuration)
setting the vtp password----------------------vtp password cisco(password)

Note:-THe switches will only replicate with the higher revision number only when the domain name is same
and the password is same(Revision number is the no. of times changes made in the server)

VTP configuration to other devices:-
vtp password cisco----------so that password is matched and synchronization starts




Vtp configuration to make client:-
vtp mode client
Note--The switch which is made a client can not create vlans afterwards

Enable vtp pruning---------vtp pruning(global configuration)
Manually hard coding to allow trunk traffic---------int f0/4,switchport mode trunk,switchport trunk allowed vlan 10
This will only allow vlan 10 traffic to pass on









Setting the communication channels:-
Get the details of the interface----------show int f0/1 (priviledge exec mode)
set the speed-----------------------------int f0/1,speed 100(global configuration)
set the duplex method---------------------int f0/1,duplex full(global configuration)











Port security:-
It can be enabled only on access ports
enable port security------------------switchport port-security mac-address [mac-address]
another method------------------------switchport port-security mac-address sticky   (means the first mac address that 	is connected)
violation occured------------------switchport port-security violation shutdown (note:-restrict maintains logs while protect does not)
To enable it----------------------switchport port-security
Again making the port up after it got shutdown----------int f0/1,shutdown,no shutdown
port security details------------show port-security interface [name]
Know which mac address it is connected to-------------show port-security address








Setting up a small office:-(video)
Network Requirement
Network Design
Communication












Routing:-
ROuting Tables-------Router makes the tables of possible route where the data can be transferred
Routing Protocols:-
IGP-Internal gateway protocol
Three types of IGP:-
Distance Vector-------RIP(Routing Information Protocol)
Link State------------OSPF(Open shortest path first)
Hybrid----------------EIGRP(Enhanced Interior Gateway routing protocol)

EGP-External gateway protocol
Types oF EGP:-
BGP-----Border gatway protocol









Static Routing:-
In static routing we have to manually configure the router and specify the network through which the packets will be transferred.
Naming convention:-
1st network and 1st router-------192.168.1.1
2nd network and 1st router-------192.168.2.1
2nd network and 2nd router-------192.168.2.2
3rd network and 2nd router-------192.168.3.2 and so on
set the static route----------------ip route [ip address where the packet will go] [SM] [router's ip connected to it]
It is done on each of the router manually









RIP routing:--
set the router rip------router rip(global configuration)
set the version --------version 2 
set the network---------network 10.0.0.0
and so on (practical)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>In this we set the network for each of the interface connected and it automatically gets to know of the route connected
>>>>>>>>>RIP takes the input in the original classful form only.No Subnet mask
for no auto summarization as it tells that the whole class is connected--------no auto-summary


Limitatios of rip:-
Auto Summarization---can be useful but it also tells if it not true(like in the subnetting 192.168.1.0/24)
Loops----------------each router starts telling by adding each hop count
Problem with distance vector

Solution of counting to infinity:-
Split Horizon------It says that the update of the router network u have received from the particular interface should not be told back about the latest update to him again
Route prison-------It says that whenever the device is inaccessible then the router of that particular network tells other router that the network is accessible through the hop count 16 (i.e. network inaccessible)


show the routing protocol used in router------show ip protocols
details of the interface------------------show ip interface f0/1
less admin rights more chance of believiability(120/1)--here 120 is the admin rights and 1 is the hop count
If no particular route is there then it goes to candidate route (*)





Router on stick:--
We can't set the two interfaces for the different networks or subnets(its not feasible) on the same router so the basic solution is to create a subinterface in router and set the each subinterface to the different network accordingly:-This technique is known as router on stick
creating the subinterface------------int g0/0.10
setting the encapsulation-----------encapsulation dot1q 10
setting the ip address---------------ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
setting the ip address---------------ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
and switch will be on the trunk mode













Ipv6 is 128 bit address
Denoted by hexadecimal digits
Grouping of zeros can be abbreviated with a double colon(per ip address)
leading zero can be omitted
anycast-------same ip address of multiple devices so whichever is near they respond(ipv6 support content delivery network)

Link Local Scope-------They help in communicating locally(auto configured)(auto generated--starts from FE80 and uses mac address )(to make the host bit 64 bits FF:FE is used in between of the mac addres)
Unique site local scope----------private ip addresss(starts from fd00)
Global unicast--------starts from 2 routable over the internet

Multicast--------starts from ff00 range

TO configure ipv6 in router only use ipv6 instead of ip.
ip address ---------its for ipv4 addres
ipv6 address---------------ipv6 address


To update the link local address:-
int g0/0
ipv6 address FE80::1 link-local					(this will update the link local address and remember only one link local address will be there and will get updated if there is anything new but simple interface will keep on upgrading when provided with the new ipaddress)


To configure ip address in EUI64 format:-
int g0/0
ip v6 address 2001::/64 eui-64					(this will save the ip v6 address in eui 64 bit format that is the FF:FE in between the mac address in the host bit)

to set the route----same command as ipv4 only ipv6 is changed
additional commnand needed----------ipv6 unicast-routing


RIP routing:-
Sets the particular interface to start routing-----------int g0/0,ipv6 rip networking enable












DNS:-
Resolver contacts to root server and then root server says that i know about the .com is stored with TLD(top level domain ) server and then resolver contacts to tld server, then tld server says that i do not have imran domain name with me but i know u should contact authoritative name server and then thus resolver contacts it and then the server tells the ip address of the file server
Two types of dns server:-Private DNS and Public DNS
In DNS we need to add records of the domain name and the ip address of the particular web server
In Web server only the hosting of the website will be there`


DHCP--DORA process
Dhcp discover
dhcp offer
dhcp request
dhcp acknowledgement

DHCP Configuration:-(this will allow to assign ip address and dns server settings to the pc)(global conf)
ip dhcp pool [network name] and enter
default-gateway 192.168.1.1
dns-server 192.168.1.2
network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
exit

2nd router:-
int f0/0(interface of the internal network),ip helper-address 192.168.2.1 (its compulosry to make router relay the dhcp request)

To allow only a specific address to assign-----ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10(just write it as it is and the router automatically checks for the particular dhcp)
Then to communicate between the devices we need to enable rip routing 















ACL:-(Access control list)
It is a mechanism that can filter the traffic
Standard ACL------Classification based on source ip(1-99 ACL no.)
Extended ACL--------classified on the basis of Source Ip,Destination ip,protocol,Port no.(100-199)
Once a match is found, no further comparison
Remember that ACL should be done beforehand configuring on router and the order of the command really matters


General Rule:-
Standard ACL apply it close to destination
Extended ACL apply it close to source

Wild card mask------------difference between the 255.255.255.255 and the subnet mask that we want to apply the acl on

Standard ACL Configuration:-
ip access-list standard Secure_MA(word)
permit host 192.168.1.130
deny 192.168.1.128 0.0.0.63				(WIld card mask)(wild card mask is for the whole subnet otherwise only the host will be denied)
deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.127				(WIld card mask)
permit any
exit

Selecting the interface where the filter is done--------int g0/0
Activating the ACL rule							----ip access-group Secure_MA out (out or in of the interface)
Show the access list---------------------show ip access-list													





ECL Configuration:-
ip access-list extended Secure_ma(word)
Permit/deny [source ip] [destination ip] [port no.]
permit 192.168.1.0/32 192.168.1.224/32 eq 80 (here also the wildcard will be used same like the standard)

webtraffic-----permit tcp 192.168.1.3/25 192.168.1.193/25 80












NAT and PAT-
NAT-Network address translation
PAT-Port address Translation

Inside Local-----source Private ip address
Inside global----source public ip
Outside local/global-----destination ip address public

Static Nat----Each device has its own public ip address
Dynamic Nat---Each device can communicate but if there are two public ip address then only two can communicate to the internet at the same time
Overloading NAT(PAT)-In this there is a single public ip address assosciated to all the devices that the can be differentiated with the port no.'s.Through its translation table it can route and get to know which device has requested to access the internet

get to know about the packets being received------debug ip icmp(priviledge exec mode)
get to know about all the nat translations-------show ip nat translations
get to know about the stats*:--------------------show ip nat statistics

Basic Configuration:-
selecting the inside and outside interface-------int g0/0,ip nat inside
										---------int g0/1,ip nat outside
										
										
Static configuration---We need to have one to one (private to public)
ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.10 200.124.22.1(inside to the outside)

Dynamic NAT--Not much required
Create an access list with any of the method classic or modern
Create a pool:---ip nat pool [name][start ip address] [end ip address] netmask [subnet mask]
ip nat inside source list [listname] pool [poolname]




PAT configuration:-
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0/24 			(whole network access list)(no need of deny)(used to identify the interesting traffic-term used to define the traffic which will be translated)
same as dynamic nat only overload is used in the end command of NAT

ANother method by the use of interface:-
ip nat inside list 1 interface g0/1(outside interface) overload

>>>>Interesting Traffic-----The traffic that we want to transfer through any particular interface or we can say the filtered traffic



















Troubleshoot:-
Wireless Controller-------This device is connected to all the Access points.Because of this device we can change the username and password or any settings for all the access points
ping------get to know about the packets received or not
tracert------tells about the every hop where the packet is being transferred
nslookup-------tells about the dns server and we can know about the each ip address

Remember log messages like (interface changed state to up) will not appear if you have a telnet connection with the router.It will only appear when the console connection is being made to the router.

Terminal Monitor---------Helps to get logs even on the telnet connection

logging synchronous--------command in the telnet configuration helps to synchronize logs between the telnet connecton made .

logging 10.1.2.10---------It will enable syslog and all the logs on the particular router will be sent to the server(global configuration)Syslog option should be enabled on the server.

show clock--------------shows the clock time
un all---------all possible debugging is off
service timestamp log msec-----------updates the log in the server with the correct timestamp


NTP- Network time protocol----updates the same time on every device.There can be a ntp master through which everything is updated.Ntp feature should be enabled on the server.
ntp server [server ip]-----------------global configuration to enable ntp

CDP-Cisco Discovery Protocol(By default is enable)
LLDP-----Link Layer Discovery Protocol(by default it is not enable on cisco)
show cdp neighbors------------------shows the connected connected to the particular device
cdp run--------------cdp protocol enabled on the system,no to disable(global configuration)
cdp enable----------enable cdp on the interface, no to disable (sub global configuration)
lldp run--------------lldp protocol enabled on the system(global configuration)
lldp transmit/receive----------enable lldp on the interface (sub global configuration)













Let's put on the hacker's hat
Router Password Recovery:-
Break sequence(different for different devices)
configuration register (0x2142)-----0x2102 loads the startup configuration. Changing to 0x2142 will load the default configuration
System reset

Blue cable------is used for connecting the laptop to the console of the router....Go to laptop->terminal and then ok and it will give access to the router configuration.(Putty software)


Steps to configure:-
First switch it off and then on(ctrl+c)
It will enter into rommon mode
type confreg 0x2142->reset.
reset(after getting the pwd)(If it was the secret pwd then u can easily change the pwd as we do it normally)
copy startup-config running-config(this will change the running to what we have in the startup)
In the end go to global configuration and type config-register 0x2012 for the loading of startup configuration
Show version---------details of config register
reload---------------reload the router(priviledge exec mode)

TO change the normal pwd normal steps to change and to change the secret password normal steps would take place
difference is that we can normal pwd but not the secret password


Switch password recovery:-
Plug off the cable and put it back on leading to restarting of switch
Press mode button for 3 seconds which will give access to rommon mode
flash_init----------it will initialize the flash
dir flash:	-----------changing directory to flash
rename flash:config.text flash:config.old--------renaming the config file
reset----------------it will restart the switch
(after this it gone to default configuration)
rename(used in real devices)
more flash:config.old----used in the packet tracer
copy the content in it and paste it on the global configuration and then it will create the config.text file again.
copy running-config startup-config






IOS backup and recovery:-
Copy from Flash to TFTP:
To do this we need to enable tftp server by enabling it from the server
show flash-----------states the current OS used in router
copy flash tftp--------copy from source to destination
and then the process

Copy from TFTP to flash:
copy tftp flash and then the process

delete flash[file name]----------------deletes the flash file
boot system flash:[file name]----------from two flash files it decides which to boot flash from the next file

If there is no flash file then it will boot from the rommon mode
Steps to recover it from rommon(read only mode monitor) mode:-
tftpdnld-------------------downloads the file from the tftp server (rommon mode configuration)
fill all the require parameters
tftp dnld and it will confirm and say yes
and at last boot/reset

IOS Licensing---------We need licensing after ios v15 for data and security and ip base is available free for permanent use















ICND2:-
Native Vlan-----------Traffic going from the switch like from vlan 20 so native vlan will be 20
VLAN Revisited
Dynamic Trunking Protocol
Problems caused by Lyer 2 problem:-
Broadcast storm
Mac address instability
Multiple copies of frame
(Not much useful)
STP(802.1d) takes about 50 seconds
RSTP(Rapid STP) takes 0-21s(latest 2004)

PortFast & BPDUGuard(temporary solution to increase the port time)
end ports:-interfaces that is connected with the end devices
spanning-tree portfast(sub configuration interface f0/0)
spanning-tree bpduguard enable(sub configuration interface f0/0)

show spanning-tree summary-------------list the summary of stp protocol
show spanning-tree summary-------------list the summary of stp protocol


Ether Channel(Not so important)
Switch Stacking:-A stackable switch is a network switch that is fully functional operating standalone but which can also be set up to operate together with one or more other network switches, with this group of switches showing the characteristics of a single switch but having the port capacity of the sum of the combined switches.


AAA-Authentication,Authorization adn accounting
Two Protocols:-
RADIUS-----Remote Authentication Dial In User Service
TACACS+----Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus


DHCP Snooping:-It is a technique to block the attack of MITM and DOS as it does not allowed end devices to send server messages.
ip dhcp snoop binding


SVI--------Switch virtual interface- It is used to help to manage the different vlan made on the switch by accessing it through ip address by creating the virtual layer 3 interface
Configuration:-(Layer 3)
int vlan 10		(creating a virtual interface 10)
ip routing------------to enable ip routing on layer 3 switching (global configuration)

On layer 3 switch to enable routing---------ip routing(global configuration)










Routing protocols:-protocols which help in communication of routers.It help them in sharing of the routes so that routing decision can be taken.
Routable protocol-------ipv4 and ipv6 used by routers to transfer packets

Interior gateway protocol:---Routing protocol used inside the organization(autonomous system)(RIP,OSPF,EIGRP)
Exterior gateway protocol:---Routing protocol used outside the organization(autonomous system)(BGP)
RIP-Distance vector
OSPF---Link cost
EIGRP---Bandwidth and delay(hybrid)

ROuter Types				Administrative Distance(Believaiblity)
Connected						0	
Static							1
EIGRP							90
OSPF							110
RIP								120








OSPF:-
Secure
Link state
Classless

How Ospf works:
Form Neighbors
Build LSDB(LInk state database)
Build Routing Table

In ospf to from neighbors then the router sends a multicast hello message which the ip is 224.0.0.5
Cost=Reference bandwidth / Link bandwidth
Area Border Router:----A router whose one interface is in the area 0 and other in the different area


DR-Designated Router
BDR-Backup Designated Router
OSPF in shared Medium:-
Need of no extra bandwidth as neighbor concept is used (no use of any shared medium)
Election for DR:-
Checking of OSPF id
Checking for Router id(whichever is greater)

The relation between the DR and the other routers will be full

OSPF databases and Tables:-
Adjacency database(Neighbor table)
Link state Database(Topology table)
Forwarding Database(Routing table)


COnfiguration:-
router ospf 1	----------------1 is the priority(1-65535)
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255(wild card mask) area 0 			--------area 0 is the compulsory to write as it is a single area


show ip ospf neighbor----------------------see the neighbors of the router
clear ip ospf process----------------------clears all the proces and restarts it



Verification:-
show ip protocols------------------details about the ip protocol
show ip ospf-----------------------details about the ospf configured
show ip ospf interfaces------------help to kow about the interfaces
show ip ospf neighbor----------------------see the neighbors of the router
show ip ospf database--------------details of the ospf database



default-information originate-------------------it tells the other router that if you do not have any info on your routing tables about the particular route then send it over this network

OSPf supports load balancing

Multiarea OSPF configuration:-
In multiarea there are many areas configured. So we need to specifically state the router that yes this particular interface is of area 45 and this specific area is of area 0

network 192.168.26.2 0.0.0.0 area 45
network 192.168.12.2 0.0.0.0 area 45
network 192.168.234.2 0.0.0.0 area 0


passive-interface fastEthernet 0/0 ----------it will give no hellos as it is a passive interface(router configuration)







EIGRP---Hybrid Protocol
Forms Neighbors
No periodic full update
Routing by gossips


How EIGRP works:-
Form neighbors
Topology Exchange
Build routing table

Without the wild card mask u can only give classful ip address
with the wil card mask u can give classless ip address


COnfiguration:-
router eigrp # (autonomous nu.  and it should be the same then only neighbor will be formed)
network 10.1.12.0  0.0.0.255
